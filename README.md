# Ticket Support System Application

A Ticket Support System App using TypeScript/ReactJS for the client side and PHP for the server.

To continue building on my Typescript and ReactJS knowledge, I thought developing a "Helpdesk" ticketing support system for users to lodge their support tickets and admins being able to respond would be a fun project to do so. The obvious choice for ReactJS would have been NodeJS however I also wanted to work on improving my knowledge of PHP as it is a battle-hardened server side language.

Note - Throughout the process I had some serious issues merging branches with main and instead of battling through just deleted the repo, and pushed up my local version or sometimes even vise versa. This explains why there isn't far more commits than would be expected in a self taught project like this!
