# Helpdesk-App

A Helpdesk App using ReactJS for the client side and PHP for the server.

To continue building on my ReactJS knowledge, I thought developing a Helpdesk ticketing system for clients / server admins to be able to communicate would be a fun project to do so. The obvious choice for ReactJS would have been NodeJS however I also wanted to work on improving my knowledge of PHP.
