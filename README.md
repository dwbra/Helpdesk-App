# Ticket Support System Application

A Ticket Support System App using TypeScript/ReactJS for the client side and PHP for the server.

To continue building on my Typescript and ReactJS knowledge, I thought developing a "Helpdesk" ticketing support system for users to lodge their support tickets and admins being able to respond would be a fun project to do so. The obvious choice for ReactJS would have been NodeJS however I also wanted to work on improving my knowledge of PHP as it is a battle-hardened server side language.
